# Flashcard-Generator
This will be a web app that will generate flashcards for you.


It allows you to choose how many flash cards you want to generate.

Once you have done that you are able to choose from a Basic Card which is Question/Answer or a Cloze Card which is a fill in the blank card.

After all cards are entered reviewing begins.  After each question you can choose to review the previous question, the card you just reviewed, or move on to the next card.
